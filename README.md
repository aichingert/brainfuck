# Brainfuck

## Why

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language which consists of only eight characters making it very simple to build an interpreter for it. Since I not only want to be able to run brainfuck code but also generate brainfuck code from some "pseudo code" as my friends and I made the challenge to solve the advent of code problems of the year 2017 in 25 unique languages like Brainfuck, APL, ASM, etc. and I would need to write a solution for one day in brainfuck anyways I decided it would be better to create a tool that can generate brainfuck code out of some language. 

## Interpreter 

In the interpreter folder is a functional brainfuck interpreter more documentation there.

## Codegen
